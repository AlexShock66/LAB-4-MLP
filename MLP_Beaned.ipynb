    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to remove the county data because we determined that it would not be as relevant as the other attributes in our dataset. Furthermore, we realized that if we were to keep it, we would need to one hot encode it as it is a cetegorical data type which would increase the number of attributes in our data signifigantly. Since a neural network's time complexist is based on the number of attributes, we decided that it would make more sense to remove the county variable completely.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose to remove variables such as TractId because it is an ID number and not relevant as a predictor of our classes. We also removed things such as race because we wanted to try to stray away from the model picking up a racial bias and wanted it to focus more on variables such as income and the types of industry in the given county.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also removed data such as how people commute to work as we determined that this data would not be very important in predicting child poverty as the types of commuting vary drastically and would only really help to determine if a county has most of the population in a city or not and it is not a good indicator as to whether or not a county will have high child poverty. It was also necessary to convert data such as number of Men and number of Women to be percentages so that they were somewhat normalized because without doing this, then a county with a higher population will appear to have more women and men than another county with lower pop. Finally, we removed data about the number of people over the age of 16 who are employed because it is already accounted for in the unemployment rate attribute and by leaving it in, we would create a stronger bias for that data without meaning to.<br/>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__NOTE:__ It may be worth while to add this data in back in the end to see if it was increases our accuracy but for now, we will leave it out. "

Choose a method for balancing the dataset and explain your reasoning for selecting this method. One option is to choose quantization thresholds for the \"ChildPoverty\" variable that equally divide the data into four classes. Should balancing of the dataset be done for both the training and testing set? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to go with pandas built in qcut function which is able to evenly divide any given series into n bins. Since we want 4 types of targets, we gave the function the number 4 for n and it ends up being the cutoff for the quartile ranges of the data. Meaning that the first bin, low child poverty, is the values from the 0th to 25th quartile and the moderate variable is the values from the 25th quartile to the 50th so on and so forth. By doing this, we are left with a roughly equivalent number of entries in each target variable. This is extremely important for the training data because without it, the model could only be good at looking at low poverty rates and would have little data to go off of in the high or extreme categories for example. This idea is not so important for the testing data because when testing, the model should be able to generalize such that it does not need an equivalent number of each class as it is not actively learning from the data and would therefore not be skewed one way or the other. I would argue that it is almost beneficial to have an uneven number of each category in the testing set because that can show if the model is able to generalize well or not."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normalized model has a slightly better performance (25.6%) compared to the raw data model (24.8%), because the attributes with higher values have the same weight as the ones with lower values now that they are in the same scale. The improvement is surprinsingly low, and we expected the normalized model to do at least 1.5x better than normal data. The normalized and one-hot encoded model is --- than the other two. This is because machine language models, such as the two layer perceptron implemented above, have a much better time dealing with one-hot encoded attributes than integer encoding as it previously was. However, the one-hot encoding brought the curse of dimensionality, and because of the amount of states and counties, the number of attributes increased to 1500+ and thus the run-time also increased dramastically (about ten-fold)."
